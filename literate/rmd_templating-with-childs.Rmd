## A function that creates ggplots

```{r}
create_plot <- function(dataset, aesthetic){

  ggplot(dataset) +
    geom_point(aesthetic)

}
```

The function above takes a dataset and an aesthetic 
made using `ggplot2::aes()` to create a plot:

```{r}
create_plot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = hp))
```

Let’s suppose that we want to generate a document 
that would look like this:

- first a section title, with the dataset used;
- then a plot

So it would look like this:

## Dataset used: "mtcars"

```{r}
create_plot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = hp))
```

We don’t want to create these sections for every 
aesthetic by hand.

Instead, we can make use of a child document that 
gets knitted separately and then embedded in the 
parent document. The chunk below makes use of this trick:

```{r, results = "asis"}

x <- list(aes(y = mpg, x = hp),
          aes(y = mpg, x = hp, size = am))

res <- lapply(x,
              function(dataset, x){

  knitr::knit_child(text = c(

    '\n',
    '## Dataset used: `r deparse(substitute(dataset))`',
    '\n',
    '```{r, echo = F}',
    'print(create_plot(dataset, x))',
    '```'

     ),
     envir = environment(),
     quiet = TRUE)

}, dataset = mtcars)


cat(unlist(res), sep = "\n")
```

The child document is the `text` argument to the 
`knit_child()` function. `text` is literal R Markdown 
code: we define a level 2 header, and then an R chunk. 
This child document gets knitted, so we need to specify 
the environment in which it should get knitted. This means
that the child document will get knitted in the same 
environment as the parent document (our current global
environment). This way, every package that gets loaded 
and every function or variable that got defined in the 
parent document will also be available to the child document.

To get the dataset name as a string, we use the 
`deparse(substitute(dataset))` trick; this substitutes 
"dataset" by its bound value, so `mtcars`. But `mtcars` is 
an expression and we don’t want it to get evaluated, or the 
contents of the entire dataset would be used in the title 
of the section. So we use `deparse()` which turns unevaluated 
expressions into strings.

We then use `lapply()` to loop over two aesthetics with an 
anonymous function that encapsulates the child document. So we 
get two child documents that get knitted, one per aesthetic. 
This gets saved into variable `res`. This is thus a list of 
knitted Markdown.

Finally, we need unlist `res` to actually merge the Markdown 
code from the child documents into the parent document.
