## A function that creates tables

```{r}
create_table <- function(dataset, var){
  table(dataset[var]) |>
    knitr::kable()
}
```


The function above uses the `table()` function to create 
frequency tables, and then this gets passed to the 
`knitr::kable()` function that produces a good looking table 
for our rendered document:

```{r}
create_table(mtcars, "am")
```


Let’s suppose that we want to generate a document that would
look like this:

- first a section title, with the name of the variable of interest
- then the table

So it would look like this:

## Frequency table for variable: "am"

```{r}
create_table(mtcars, "am")
```


We don’t want to create these sections for
every variable by hand.

Instead, we can define a function that
returns the R markdown code required to
create this. This is this function:

```{r}
return_section <- function(dataset, var){
  a <- knitr::knit_expand(text = c(
               "## Frequency table for variable: {{variable}}",
                create_table(dataset, var)),
                variable = var)
  cat(a, sep = "\n")
}
```


This new function, `return_section()` uses 
`knitr::knit_expand()` to generate RMarkdown 
code. Words between `{{}}` get replaced by 
the provided `var` argument to the function. 
So when we call `return_section("am")`, 
`{{variable}}` is replaced by `"am"`. `"am"` 
then gets passed down to `create_table()` 
and the frequency table gets generated. 
We can now generate all the section by simply
applying our function to a list of column names:

```{r, results = "asis"}
invisible(lapply(colnames(mtcars), return_section, dataset = mtcars))
# works also:
# but if you don’t wrap the call to lapply() inside invisible(), 
# then a bunch of NULLs will also get printed 
# (NULLs get returned by functions that don’t return anything)
#lapply(colnames(mtcars), return_section, dataset = mtcars)
# works also:
#purrr::walk(colnames(mtcars), return_section, dataset = mtcars)
# works also - but with NULL ouput (like invisible):
#purrr::map(colnames(mtcars), return_section, dataset = mtcars)
```
