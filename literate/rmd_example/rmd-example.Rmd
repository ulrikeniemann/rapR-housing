In this example we embed parts of the examples from the
\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:

```{r}
data (airquality)
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```


which shows that the location parameter of the Ozone
distribution varies significantly from month to month.
Finally we include a boxplot of the data:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

it is possible to run a bash command by adding this chunk to the source:

(bashâ€™s pwd command shows the current working directory)

(see chapter_7.R for bash installation and add path)

```{bash}
pwd
```
