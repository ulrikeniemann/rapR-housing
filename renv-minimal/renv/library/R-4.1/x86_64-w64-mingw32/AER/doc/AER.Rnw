\Abstract{
  ``Applied Econometrics with \proglang{R}''
  \citep[Springer-Verlag, ISBN~978-0-387-77316-2, pp.~vii+222]{AER:Kleiber+Zeileis:2008}
  is the first book on applied econometrics using the \proglang{R}~system
  for statistical computing and graphics \citep{AER:R:2008}. 
  It presents hands-on examples for a
  wide range of econometric models, from classical linear regression models for
  cross-section, time series or panel data and the common non-linear models of
  microeconometrics, such as logit, probit, tobit models as well as regression
  models for count data, to recent
  semiparametric extensions. In addition, it provides a chapter on programming,
  including simulations, optimization and an introduction to \proglang{R} tools
  enabling reproducible econometric research. 
  The methods are presented by illustrating, among other things, the fitting
  of wage equations, growth regressions, hedonic regressions, dynamic
  regressions and time series models as well as models of labor force
  participation or the demand for health care.

  The book is accompanied by the \proglang{R} package
  \pkg{AER} \citep{AER:Zeileis+Kleiber:2008} which contains some new \proglang{R}
  functionality, some 100 data sets
  taken from a wide variety of sources, the full source code for all examples
  used in the book, as well as further worked examples, e.g., from popular textbooks.

  This vignette provides an overview of the package contains and contains
  a list of errata for the book.

\section{Package overview}

\subsection[R code from the book]{\proglang{R} code from the book}

The full \proglang{R} code from the book is provided in the demos for
\pkg{AER} the package. The source scripts can be found in the \code{demo}
directory of the package and executed interactively by calling
\fct{demo}, e.g.,

<<demo, eval=FALSE>>=
demo("Ch-Intro", package = "AER")
@

One demo per chapter is provided:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{Ch-Intro} (Chapter~1: Introduction),
  \item \code{Ch-Basics} (Chapter~2: Basics),
  \item \code{Ch-LinearRegression} (Chapter~3: Linear Regression),
  \item \code{Ch-Validation} (Chapter~4: Diagnostics and Alternative Methods of Regression),
  \item \code{Ch-Microeconometrics} (Chapter~5: Models of Microeconometrics),
  \item \code{Ch-TimeSeries} (Chapter~6: Time Series),
  \item \code{Ch-Programming} (Chapter~7: Programming Your Own Analysis).
\end{itemize}
This list of demos is also shown by \code{demo(package = "AER")}.

The same scripts are contained in the \code{tests} directory of the package
so that they are automatically checked and compared with the desired output
provided in \code{.Rout.save} files.

To make the code fully reproducible and to avoid some lengthy computations
in the daily checks, a few selected code chunks are commented in the scripts.
Also, for technical reasons, some graphics code chunks are repeated, once commented
and once without comments.


\subsection{Data sets}

The \pkg{AER} package includes some 100 data sets from leading applied
econometrics journals and popular econometrics textbooks. Many data sets
have been obtained from the data archives of the \emph{Journal of Applied
Econometrics} and the \emph{Journal of Business \& Economic Statistics}. 
Some of these have been used in recent textbooks, among them 
\cite{AER:Baltagi:2002}, \cite{AER:Davidson+MacKinnon:2004}, \cite{AER:Greene:2003},
\cite{AER:Stock+Watson:2007}, and \cite{AER:Verbeek:2004}. In addition, we provide
all further data sets from \cite{AER:Baltagi:2002},  \cite{AER:Franses:1998},
\cite{AER:Greene:2003}, and \cite{AER:Stock+Watson:2007}.

Detailed information about the source of each data set, descriptions of
the variables included, and usually also examples for typical analyses
are provided on the respective manual pages. A full list of all data sets
in \pkg{AER} can be obtained via:

<<data, eval=FALSE>>=
data(package = "AER")
@

Additionally, overview manual pages for some textbooks are provided.
They list all data sets from the respective book and provide extensive
code for replicating many of the empirical examples. See, e.g.
<<help, eval=FALSE>>=
help("Greene2003", package = "AER")
@
for data sets and code for \cite{AER:Greene:2003}.
The overview manual pages currently available in \pkg{AER} are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{Baltagi2002} for \cite{AER:Baltagi:2002},
  \item \code{CameronTrivedi1998} for \cite{AER:Cameron+Trivedi:1998},
  \item \code{Franses1998} for \cite{AER:Franses:1998},
  \item \code{Greene2003} for \cite{AER:Greene:2003},
  \item \code{StockWatson2007} for \cite{AER:Stock+Watson:2007}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection[New R functions]{New \proglang{R} functions}

\pkg{AER} provides a few new \proglang{R} functions extending
or complementing methods previously available in \proglang{R}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \fct{tobit} is a convenience interface to \fct{survreg}
        from package \pkg{survival} for fitting tobit regressions
	to censored data. In addition to the fitting function itself,
	the usual set of accessor and extractor functions is
	provided, e.g., \fct{print}, \fct{summary}, \fct{logLik},
	etc. For more details see \code{?tobit}.
  \item \fct{ivreg} fits instrumental-variable regressions
        via two-stage least squares. It provides a formula
	interface and calls the workhorse function \fct{ivreg.fit}
	which in turn calls \fct{lm.fit} twice. In addition to the fitting functions,
	the usual set of accessor and extractor functions is
	provided, e.g., \fct{print}, \fct{summary}, \fct{anova}, etc.
	For more details see \code{?ivreg}, \code{?ivreg.fit},
	and \code{?summary.ivreg}, respectively.
  \item \fct{dispersiontest} tests the null hypothesis of
        equidispersion in Poisson regressions against the alternative
	of overdispersion and/or underdispersion. For more details
	see \code{?dispersiontest}.
\end{itemize}
